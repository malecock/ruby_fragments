Hi Phil,\n\nI'm a fan of Causes and very interested in joining your team.  I didn't see a position that's a match posted on your jobs site, so I thought I'd reach out to you directly.\n\nWe met a year ago (or more) at a Google publisher event.  At that time, I was the Ad Ops Manager at Scribd.  I left 4-months ago to start a new venture, which I have decided not to continue.\n\nI'm now reaching out to contacts/companies that are interesting and am hoping to find out if I might be a fit for a position at Causes.  I'd love to connect with you and discuss.\n\n
Very best,\n
Matt Alecock
